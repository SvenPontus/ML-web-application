# ML-web-application

This application enables ML operations from a school assignment. 
The primary objective is to load a CSV file and create various models for both 
classification and regression tasks. It features both a Flask version for web 
application use and a terminal UI. Although the program contains some bugs and 
is not entirely error-free, it marks my first project upload. I am eager to 
progress in my programming journey and look forward to showcasing more refined 
work in the future.
